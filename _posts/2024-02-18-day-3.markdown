Another productive day in the books! Here's what I've been up to:

### Networking Updates 🤝
* Got a response from yesterday's conversation with my old colleague - now playing the waiting game for next steps
* Received a LinkedIn tip from a contact about companies hiring PMs
  * Plot twist: positions are filled, but now I have a nice list of companies to watch! 👀

### Learning & Growth 🧠
* Watched "Creating an AI Agent for Financial Report Analysis" on DataCamp
  * Planning to do the hands-on coding tomorrow - excited to get my hands dirty!
* Completed the RiseSmart career personality quiz
  * Results: I'm an Analyzer | Naturalist blend
  * Fun insight: My love for the outdoors might have skewed the results a bit 🌲
  * Note to self: Maybe should've focused more on work experiences than my save-the-planet vibes 😅

### Career Development 📈
* Finally submitted those forms for RiseSmart resume writer assignment
* Explored the interview practice tools on RiseSmart's platform
* Deep-dove into their job search portal - some neat features there!

### Strategic Thinking 🎯
Been wrestling with some key decisions:
* How to balance my time between:
  * Sending out applications
  * Taking training courses
  * Practicing for coding interviews
* Need to find that sweet spot between upskilling and actual job hunting

### Tomorrow's Game Plan 📝
1. Tackle that DataCamp coding exercise
2. Start mapping out a structured schedule for applications vs. learning
3. Make the most of RiseSmart's interview practice tools

Today's reflection: Sometimes the hardest part isn't the job search itself, but figuring out how to approach it strategically! 🎯
