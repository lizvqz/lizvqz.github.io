Another day of hustling! Here's today's rundown:

### Tech Setup Marathon 💻
Got my dev environment all decked out:
* Node.js ✓
* pnpm ✓
* Docker & Docker Compose ✓
* PostgreSQL ✓

All this for a personal project I'm cooking up - more on that later!

### Networking Moves 🤝
* Reached out to an old colleague - even though their company has no job postings right now. Plot twist: they want to chat anyway about potential future openings! Sometimes it's all about timing.
* Thinking about hitting up my previous mentor (from that cool mentorship program at my last job). Their company's got some interesting openings - need to dig deeper into those.

### Career Path Contemplation 🤔
Been doing some soul-searching about which path to focus on:
* Technical Project Manager/Scrum Master
* Cybersecurity
* Data Engineering

The cool thing? I've genuinely enjoyed every role I've had. There's always something new to learn, and that's what gets me excited! Maybe being adaptable is my superpower? 🦸‍♀️

### Work-Life Balance ⛰️
* Hit up a local hiking trail with a friend
* Bonus: They're spreading the word about my job search to their partner
* Mental note: Check out their company's openings too!

### Action Items 📝
1. Speed up the resume writer assignment process - feeling antsy about getting that polished!
2. Deep dive into my old mentor's company job listings
3. Talk to my skip manager about that Citizens position - might as well shoot my shot, right?

Today's motto: Keep pushing forward, but don't forget to breathe (and hike) 🌲
