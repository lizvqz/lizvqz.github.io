Today marks the beginning of my dedicated job search journey in tech. I've decided to document this process not only for myself but also to help others who might be on a similar path.

## Why Document This Journey?

1. **Accountability**: Writing about my progress keeps me accountable and motivated
2. **Reflection**: Documenting my experiences helps me reflect and learn from them
3. **Community**: Sharing my journey might help others in similar situations
4. **Growth**: Tracking my progress shows how far I've come

## My Goals

As I begin this journey, I'm setting some initial goals:

- Document my daily/weekly progress
- Share both successes and challenges
- Track skills I'm developing
- Network and connect with others in tech
- Learn from each interview experience

Stay tuned as I share more about my preparation, job applications, interview experiences, and lessons learned along the way.
