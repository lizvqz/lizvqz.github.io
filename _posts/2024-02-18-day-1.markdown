Kicked off my job search today! Here's what went down:

### Career Support Setup 💪
Had my first chat with my Randstad RiseSmart career coach - they'll be helping me navigate this whole job hunt thing. Pretty cool to have someone in my corner!

### Networking Win 🤝
Jumped on a Zoom call with an old colleague from a few years back. They've got some solid connections and offered to help get my resume in front of the right people. Love when past connections come through!

### Tech Setup & Blog Launch 🚀
* Got my hands dirty with some tech setup:
  * Set up Ruby using rbenv
  * Got Jekyll up and running
  * Launched this blog (hosted on GitHub!)

### Cool Tech Tools I'm Using ⚡
* Building this blog with help from:
  * ChatGPT for initial setup
  * VS Code Insiders as my trusty editor
  * Claude 3.5 Sonnet for the blog tweaks (and it's doing a pretty sweet job!)

### Job Opportunities 🤔
There's this interesting position at Citizens that caught my eye. It's a hybrid role though, so I'm weighing the pros and cons. Might need to look into getting a studio closer to the office if I go for it. Decisions, decisions...
