Welcome! I'm Gloria Vazquez, a tech professional with experience in both software development and project management. I'm currently seeking roles that leverage my unique blend of technical and leadership skills - whether that's as a Technical Project Manager, Scrum Master, Software Engineer, or a hybrid role that combines these areas.

Through these posts, I'll share my journey of finding that perfect role where I can apply my diverse skill set. I'll document my experiences, strategies, interview insights, and lessons learned along the way. Whether you're a fellow tech professional looking to blend technical and management roles, or someone curious about career transitions in tech, I hope my experiences provide valuable insights.

Below you'll find my latest updates and reflections!
